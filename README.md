Fast Ai based classifier which tells if you are talking about the Company or the Fruit

### Dependencies
 Data Augmentation is optional. Since the original txt files had few paragraphs, augmentation was done using spacy and nltk
 The classifier is built using Fastai text classifier
 
 ### Running the notebooks
 
 You can run the notebook in Google Colab without worrying about any dependencies. 
 The trained model is added as trained_model.pkl that you can upload to directly use while testing
 
 
### Acknowledgements
